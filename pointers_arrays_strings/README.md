0- Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

    Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

1- Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

    Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

2- Write a function that returns the length of a string.

    Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

3- Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

    Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

4- Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

5- Write a function that reverses a string.

    Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

6- Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void puts2(char *str);

7- Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
    The function should print the second half of the string
    If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

8- Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
    where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
    Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
    The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
    You are allowed to use printf


9- 
    Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

    Return value: the pointer to dest


10- Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

    Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);
    The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
    You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
    If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
    You are not allowed to use long
    You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array
    You are not allowed to hard-code special values
    We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.

11- Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
    This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
    Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

12- Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
    The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
        it will use at most n bytes from src; and
        src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
    Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

13- Write a function that copies a string.

    Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
    Your function should work exactly like strncpy

14- Write a function that compares two strings.

    Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
    Your function should work exactly like strcmp

15- Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

    Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
    Where n is the number of elements of the array

16- Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

    Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);

17- Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

    Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);
    Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

18- Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

    Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
    Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
    Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
    Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
    Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
    Prototype: char *leet(char *);
    You can only use one if in your code
    You can only use two loops in your code
    You are not allowed to use switch
    You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
