9- 
    Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

    Return value: the pointer to dest


10- Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

    Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);
    The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
    You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
    If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
    You are not allowed to use long
    You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array
    You are not allowed to hard-code special values
    We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.

11- Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
    This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
    Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

12- Write a function that concatenates two strings.

    Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
    The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
        it will use at most n bytes from src; and
        src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
    Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

13- Write a function that copies a string.

    Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
    Your function should work exactly like strncpy

14- Write a function that compares two strings.

    Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
    Your function should work exactly like strcmp

15- Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

    Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
    Where n is the number of elements of the array

16- Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

    Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);

17- Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

    Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);
    Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

18- Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

    Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
    Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
    Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
    Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
    Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
    Prototype: char *leet(char *);
    You can only use one if in your code
    You can only use two loops in your code
    You are not allowed to use switch
    You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
19- Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

    Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
    The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
    Returns a pointer to the memory area s


20- Write a function that copies memory area.

    Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
    The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
    Returns a pointer to dest


21- Write a function that locates a character in a string.

    Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
    Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found


22- Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

    Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
    Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept


23- Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

    Prototype: char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
    The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
    Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found


24- Write a function that locates a substring.

    Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
    The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
    Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.


25- Write a function that prints the chessboard.

    Prototype: void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);


26- Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

    Prototype: void print_diagsums(int *a, int size);
    Format: see example
